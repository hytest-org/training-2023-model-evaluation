# Model Evaluation (2023)

## Training Overview
This HyTEST model evaluation course teaches students the foundations of scientific model evaluation, as well as how to apply those foundations to evaluate big datasets in the cloud using [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/about.html), an open-source Python platform for distributed computing.

Using a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises in Jupyter Notebooks, we will cover data access and preparation, identifying and computing statistical evaluation metrics, and visualization of results. Furthermore, we consider how workflows can be modified for individual purposes and/or other use-cases. 


## Learning Outcomes
On the technical side,
students will become familar with fundamental components of the Pangeo architecture, including S3, `Dask`, `intake`, `xarray`, and `hvplot`.
On the theory side,
students will learn about theory of model evaluation, how to compute and interpret different metrics for benchmarking model performance.
By the end, the student should be able to take the output of a geoscientific model, choose a meaningful suite of performance metrics, then use Pangeo to compute them and visualize the result.
