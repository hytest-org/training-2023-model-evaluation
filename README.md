# training-2023-model-evaluation

## Training Overview 
Briefly summarize technical side and theory side of the course

## Learning Outcomes
During the training, students will use `Pangeo,` a popular Python enviornment for distributed computing and receive training on some of the fundamental technical components of the Pangeo architecture, including
- S3 for cloud object storage
- `Dask` for parallelization
- `intake` for cataloging data
- `hvplot` for vizualization 
The student will use each of these technical components to evaluate the performance of the National Water Model.
In so doing, they will learn about
- the theory of model evaluation
- best practices for applying that theory, and
- how to interpret standard evaluation metrics
